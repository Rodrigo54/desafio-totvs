Its body is segmented and it stands on four pointed legs. It has two large claws at the front, the tips of which release poison, and a similar large pincer on its tail. It can rotate its head 180 degrees. Drapion typically reside in the desert, although they have been spotted in marshland.\nAlthough Drapion is Poison/Dark type, it evolves from Skorupi which is Poison/Bug type, thus loses its Bug type upon evolution - a rare occurrence for Pokémon.",
